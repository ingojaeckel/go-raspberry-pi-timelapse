### Build steps

#### Step 1: Initial Build

1. Optional: If you want to use the battery backed clocked start by soldering the 2x20-pin strip on Pi Zero W board ([instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/wiring-the-rtc)). After the soldering, attach the RTC to the 2x20-pin strip. Don't forget to insert the CR1220 battery into the RTC. 
2. Connect the Pi Zero W and the Pi Camera Board v2 via the Pi Zero Camera cable.
3. Insert the Pi Zero W into the C4Labs Zerbra Zero Case.

#### Step 2: Install disk image and access web interface

1. From another computer, download, and decompress the `.img` file of the [most recent go-raspberry-pi-timelapse release](https://github.com/ingojaeckel/go-raspberry-pi-timelapse/releases).
2. Install the `.img` file to an empty SD card using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).
3. Insert the SD card card into the Pi Zero W.
4. Turn on the Pi Zero W plugging in a micro USB cable into the PWR IN connector (bottom right corner).
5. The Pi Zero W will act as a Wifi access point. Connect to the Pi's Wifi named `timelapse-raspberry-pi`, passphrase: `InsertTheRealPassword`.
6. Open the Pi's web interface in a browser: `http://192.168.50.1:8080/`. This interface will allow you to align the camera, download photos, shutdown the Pi, etc.

## üî¨ Experimental: C++ Object Detection

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand C++ Object Detection details</b></summary>

This repository also includes an experimental C++ application for real-time object detection, located in the [`cpp-object-detection/`](cpp-object-detection/) directory.

### Purpose & Comparison

| Feature | Go Timelapse (Main Project) | C++ Object Detection (Experimental) |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Scheduled timelapse photography | Real-time object detection & tracking |
| **Hardware Target** | Raspberry Pi Zero W | Higher-performance systems (Pi 4, desktop) |
| **Camera Input** | Pi Camera Module (CSI) | USB webcams |
| **Processing** | Minimal - just capture images | AI/ML object detection (YOLO) |
| **Resource Usage** | Very low power | Higher CPU/memory requirements |
| **Output** | Scheduled still images | Continuous detection logs & optional images |
| **Use Cases** | Time-lapse videos, construction monitoring | Security monitoring, wildlife observation |
| **Maturity** | Production-ready | Experimental/Research |

### Key Features of C++ Object Detection

- **Real-time detection** using YOLO models at 720p
- **Object tracking** with movement detection
- **Network streaming** via MJPEG
- **Headless operation** for embedded systems
- **GPU acceleration** support (CUDA/OpenCL)
- **Smart photo storage** - only saves images when objects are detected
- **Long-term operation** optimized for continuous 24/7 deployment

### Getting Started

For more information about the C++ object detection application, see the [cpp-object-detection/README.md](cpp-object-detection/README.md).

**Note:** The C++ application is experimental and designed for different use cases than the main timelapse project. It requires more powerful hardware and has different dependencies (OpenCV, ONNX runtime).
