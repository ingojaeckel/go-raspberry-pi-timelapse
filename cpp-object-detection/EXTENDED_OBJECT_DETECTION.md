# Extended Object Detection - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of extended object detection support beyond just 'person' detection.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. Centralized Target Class List ✅
- **Location:** `src/object_detector.cpp::getTargetClasses()`
- **Previously:** Target classes were duplicated in multiple locations
- **Now:** Single source of truth for target object classes

### 2. Extended Object Types ✅
The following object types are now monitored:

**People:**
- person

**Vehicles:**
- car, truck, bus, motorcycle, bicycle

**Animals:**
- cat, dog, bird *(new)*

**Furniture & Objects:**
- chair *(new)*, book *(new)*

**Notes:**
- "fox" and "painting" requested but NOT available in COCO dataset (80 classes)
- Fox may occasionally be detected as "cat" or "dog" with lower confidence
- All classes listed above are part of the COCO dataset and fully supported

### 3. Bounding Box Drawing ✅
- **Implementation:** `src/parallel_frame_processor.cpp::saveDetectionPhoto()`
- **Behavior:** Automatically draws colored bounding boxes for ALL detected target objects
- **Label:** Shows class name and confidence percentage

### 4. Color Coding ✅
Each object type has a unique color for easy visual identification:

| Object Type | Color | BGR Value |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Person | Green | (0, 255, 0) |
| Cat | Red | (0, 0, 255) |
| Dog | Blue | (255, 0, 0) |
| Bird | Cyan | (255, 255, 0) |
| Car/Truck/Bus | Yellow | (0, 255, 255) |
| Motorcycle/Bicycle | Magenta | (255, 0, 255) |
| Chair | Purple | (128, 0, 128) |
| Book | Orange | (255, 128, 0) |

### 5. Filename Generation ✅
- **Implementation:** `src/parallel_frame_processor.cpp::generateFilename()`
- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD HHMMSS [objects] detected.jpg`
- **Examples:**
  - `2025-10-04 143022 person detected.jpg`
  - `2025-10-04 143522 bird chair detected.jpg`
  - `2025-10-04 201530 book person detected.jpg`
- **Behavior:** Automatically includes ALL detected object types in filename

### 6. Logging ✅
- **Implementation:** `src/parallel_frame_processor.cpp::processFrameInternal()`
- **Format:** `detected [class] at coordinates: (x, y) with confidence N%`
- **Examples:**
  ```
  detected person at coordinates: (640, 360) with confidence 92%
  detected bird at coordinates: (320, 240) with confidence 87%
  detected chair at coordinates: (100, 400) with confidence 78%
  Saved detection photo: detections/2025-10-04 143022 bird chair person detected.jpg
  ```
- **Behavior:** Logs each detected object with its type, coordinates, and confidence

### 7. Tests Updated ✅
- **File:** `tests/test_object_detector.cpp`
- **Tests Modified:**
  - `GetTargetClasses`: Now validates bird, chair, and book are included
  - `IsTargetClass`: Tests new object types as valid targets
  - Negative tests added for fox and painting (not in COCO dataset)

## Technical Details

### Changes Made

1. **src/object_detector.cpp**
   - Updated `getTargetClasses()` to include: bird, chair, book
   - Updated comments to reflect "fox" and "painting" are not in COCO

2. **include/detection_model_interface.hpp**
   - Removed duplicate `getTargetClasses()` static method
   - Centralized to ObjectDetector class only

3. **src/parallel_frame_processor.cpp**
   - Added color mappings for bird (cyan), chair (purple), book (orange)
   - No other changes needed - existing code is generic

4. **tests/test_object_detector.cpp**
   - Extended test coverage for new object types
   - Added negative test cases for non-COCO objects

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md
   - Updated PHOTO_STORAGE_FEATURE.md

### Validation

All existing functionality automatically supports the new object types:
- ✅ Detection filtering uses `isTargetClass()` dynamically
- ✅ Bounding box drawing iterates over all detections
- ✅ Logging uses `detection.class_name` for any object
- ✅ Filename generation collects all unique object types

## Usage

No changes to command-line interface or configuration required. The new object types are automatically monitored when they appear in the camera view.

```bash
# Run with default settings - will now detect all supported object types
./object_detection

# Example output:
# detected bird at coordinates: (320, 240) with confidence 87%
# detected chair at coordinates: (100, 400) with confidence 78%
# Saved detection photo: detections/2025-10-04 143022 bird chair detected.jpg
```

## COCO Dataset Reference

The COCO dataset (used by YOLO models) contains 80 object classes. The following requested objects are available:
- ✅ person (class 0)
- ✅ bicycle (class 1)
- ✅ car (class 2)
- ✅ motorcycle (class 3)
- ✅ bus (class 5)
- ✅ truck (class 7)
- ✅ bird (class 14)
- ✅ cat (class 15)
- ✅ dog (class 16)
- ✅ chair (class 56)
- ✅ book (class 73)

Not available in COCO:
- ❌ fox (similar animals: cat, dog)
- ❌ painting (similar objects: potentially "picture" but not standard COCO class)
