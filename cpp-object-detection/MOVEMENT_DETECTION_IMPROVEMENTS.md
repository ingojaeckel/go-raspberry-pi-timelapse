# Object Movement Detection Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the object movement detection system in the C++ Object Detection application.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation had limited observability and tracking capabilities:
- Only tracked current and previous position (2 data points)
- Limited debug logging around distance calculations
- No path analysis for movement patterns
- First-match algorithm could incorrectly associate objects

## Improvements Made

### 1. Position History Tracking

**Before:**
```cpp
struct ObjectTracker {
    cv::Point2f center;
    cv::Point2f previous_center;
    // ... other fields
};
```

**After:**
```cpp
struct ObjectTracker {
    cv::Point2f center;
    cv::Point2f previous_center;
    std::deque<cv::Point2f> position_history;  // NEW: Track path of movement
    static constexpr size_t MAX_POSITION_HISTORY = 10;  // Keep last 10 positions
    // ... other fields
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains up to 10 recent positions for each tracked object
- Enables movement pattern analysis
- Provides richer data for decision making
- Automatically limits memory usage via MAX_POSITION_HISTORY

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging

Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the tracking pipeline:

**Detection Processing:**
```
Processing detection: person at (320.5, 240.3)
  Distance to existing person at (315.2, 238.1): 5.6 pixels
  Matched to existing person (distance: 5.6 pixels)
```

**Movement Pattern Analysis:**
```
Movement pattern: 5 positions tracked, total path length: 28.4 pixels
Movement analysis for person: 5 positions in history, 
  average step size: 5.68 pixels, overall displacement: 22.36 pixels
```

**Object Lifecycle:**
```
Creating new tracker for cat (no existing object within 100 pixel threshold)
Removing dog tracker (not seen for 31 frames)
```

**Movement Logging:**
```
Checking movement for person: distance = 6.2 pixels, 
  from (320.5, 240.3) to (326.7, 241.5)
Logging movement: person moved 6.2 pixels [avg step: 5.8 px, overall path: 28.4 px]
Movement below threshold (2.3 < 5.0 pixels) - not logging
```

### 3. Improved Matching Algorithm

**Before:**
- Used first-match within threshold
- Could match wrong object if multiple candidates exist

**After:**
- Finds closest match among all candidates
- More accurate object association
- Reduces false movements

```cpp
// Find the closest matching object within threshold
float min_distance = MAX_MOVEMENT_DISTANCE;
ObjectTracker* best_match = nullptr;

for (auto& tracked : tracked_objects_) {
    if (tracked.object_type == detection.class_name) {
        float distance = cv::norm(tracked.center - detection_center);
        if (distance < min_distance) {
            min_distance = distance;
            best_match = &tracked;
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Movement Pattern Analysis

The system now calculates and logs:
- **Average step size**: Mean distance between consecutive positions in history
- **Overall displacement**: Total distance from oldest to newest position
- **Path length**: Sum of all movement segments

This provides insights into object behavior:
- Smooth vs. erratic movement
- Consistent vs. random direction
- Overall trajectory

## Usage

### Enabling Debug Logging

To see the enhanced debug output, run the application with verbose mode:

```bash
./object_detection --verbose
```

### Example Output

With verbose logging enabled, you'll see detailed movement tracking:

```
[DEBUG] Processing detection: person at (320, 240)
[DEBUG]   Distance to existing person at (315, 238): 5.4 pixels
[DEBUG]   Matched to existing person (distance: 5.4 pixels)
[DEBUG]   Movement pattern: 7 positions tracked, total path length: 42.3 pixels
[DEBUG] Checking movement for person: distance = 5.4 pixels, from (315, 238) to (320, 240)
[DEBUG] Movement analysis for person: 7 positions in history, average step size: 6.0 pixels, overall displacement: 35.7 pixels
[DEBUG] Logging movement: person moved 5.4 pixels [avg step: 6.0 px, overall path: 35.7 px]
[INFO] person seen earlier moved from (315, 238) -> (320, 240) (87% confidence)
```

## Testing

Two new tests were added to verify the improvements:

1. **ObjectTrackerStructure**: Validates the position_history field exists and works correctly
2. **PositionHistoryLimit**: Ensures the history is limited to MAX_POSITION_HISTORY entries

All existing tests continue to pass, confirming backward compatibility.

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Each tracker maintains up to 10 positions (20 floats = ~80 bytes per tracker)
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead for distance calculations and history management
- **Logging**: Debug output only generated when `--verbose` flag is used

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Velocity Estimation**: Use position history to calculate object speed and direction
2. **Prediction**: Predict where object will be in next frame
3. **Trajectory Classification**: Identify movement patterns (linear, circular, erratic)
4. **Smart Thresholds**: Adjust MAX_MOVEMENT_DISTANCE based on object velocity
5. **Path Smoothing**: Apply filtering to reduce jitter in tracked positions

## Configuration

Key constants that can be adjusted:

```cpp
// In object_detector.cpp
constexpr float MAX_MOVEMENT_DISTANCE = 100.0f;  // Max pixels between frames

// In object_detector.hpp
static constexpr size_t MAX_POSITION_HISTORY = 10;  // Positions to track
```

## Summary

These improvements provide:
- ✅ Better observability through enhanced debug logging
- ✅ Richer movement data via position history
- ✅ More accurate object tracking with closest-match algorithm
- ✅ Movement pattern analysis for better decision making
- ✅ Foundation for future enhancements
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing code
