# Scene Persistence Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This feature implements scene recognition and persistence using SQLite. After observing stationary objects for 1 minute, the system analyzes the scene, extracts detailed properties, and either matches it to a previously recorded scene or saves it as a new scene. This enables the system to recognize when the camera has returned to a familiar viewing angle or scene composition.

## Key Features

### 1. Scene Analysis
- **Stationary Object Detection**: Analyzes stationary objects after 60 seconds of observation
- **Object Properties**: Extracts color, size, position, and orientation for each stationary object
- **Spatial Relationships**: Calculates distances and angles between objects
- **Scene Fingerprinting**: Creates a unique fingerprint based on object types, counts, and spatial distribution

### 2. Fuzzy Matching
- **Tolerance for Camera Movement**: Matches scenes even when camera angle shifts slightly
- **Multi-dimensional Similarity**: Compares object counts (40%), spatial distribution (40%), and relationships (20%)
- **Threshold-based Matching**: Requires 75% similarity to match an existing scene
- **Position Independence**: Focuses on relative positions rather than absolute coordinates

### 3. SQLite Persistence
- **Normalized Schema**: Separate tables for scenes, objects, and relationships
- **Efficient Querying**: Indexed by timestamp for quick lookups
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses transactions for data integrity
- **Compact Storage**: Stores only essential scene metadata

## Database Schema

### Tables

#### `scenes`
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY): Unique scene identifier
- `created_at` (INTEGER): Unix timestamp when scene was first identified
- `description` (TEXT): Human-readable description (e.g., "2x cars, 1x person")
- `object_counts` (TEXT): Serialized object type counts
- `spatial_histogram` (BLOB): 4x4 grid of object positions

#### `scene_objects`
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY): Unique object identifier
- `scene_id` (INTEGER): Foreign key to scenes table
- `object_type` (TEXT): Type of object (person, car, etc.)
- `position_x`, `position_y` (REAL): Position in frame
- `color_b`, `color_g`, `color_r` (INTEGER): Average color
- `size_width`, `size_height` (INTEGER): Object dimensions
- `orientation` (REAL): Orientation angle

#### `object_relationships`
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY): Unique relationship identifier
- `scene_id` (INTEGER): Foreign key to scenes table
- `object1_idx`, `object2_idx` (INTEGER): Indices of related objects
- `distance` (REAL): Pixel distance between object centers
- `angle` (REAL): Angle between objects in radians

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### `SceneManager` Class
Main class responsible for scene analysis and persistence.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize()`: Creates database schema
- `shouldAnalyzeScene()`: Checks if enough time has passed with stationary objects
- `analyzeAndMatchScene()`: Analyzes current scene and matches/saves
- `analyzeStationaryObjects()`: Extracts detailed properties from tracked objects
- `createFingerprint()`: Generates scene fingerprint for matching
- `findMatchingScene()`: Fuzzy matches against existing scenes
- `calculateSimilarity()`: Computes similarity score (0.0-1.0) between fingerprints

### Scene Matching Algorithm

The fuzzy matching algorithm uses three components:

1. **Object Count Similarity (40% weight)**
   - Compares types and counts of objects
   - Uses min/max ratio for each object type
   - Handles missing types gracefully

2. **Spatial Distribution Similarity (40% weight)**
   - Divides frame into 4x4 grid
   - Counts objects in each cell
   - Uses OpenCV histogram correlation

3. **Relationship Similarity (20% weight)**
   - Compares distances between object pairs
   - Accepts 20% tolerance in distances
   - Counts matching relationships

**Similarity Threshold:** 0.75 (75% similarity required to match)

### Integration Points

1. **Configuration (`config_manager.hpp/cpp`)**
   - `--enable-scene-persistence`: Enable/disable feature
   - `--scene-db-path PATH`: Set database location (default: scenes.db)

2. **Application Context (`application_context.hpp`)**
   - Added `scene_manager` field
   - Initialized in `initializeComponents()`

3. **Main Processing Loop (`application.cpp`)**
   - Checks `shouldAnalyzeScene()` each iteration
   - Calls `analyzeAndMatchScene()` when ready
   - Non-blocking operation

## Usage

### Enable Scene Persistence

```bash
./object_detection --enable-scene-persistence
```

### Custom Database Path

```bash
./object_detection --enable-scene-persistence --scene-db-path /path/to/scenes.db
```

### Example Output

When a new scene is identified:
```
[INFO] New scene identified: id=1 (2x cars, 1x person)
```

When returning to a familiar scene:
```
[INFO] Recognized return to earlier scene: id=1 (2x cars, 1x person)
```

## Model Recommendations

For optimal scene analysis and object property extraction, we recommend:

### Primary Model: YOLOv5l (High Accuracy)
- **Accuracy**: 85% relative accuracy
- **Inference Time**: ~120ms
- **Benefits**: Better object localization and boundary detection
- **Use Case**: When precision is more important than speed

```bash
./object_detection --model-type yolov5l --enable-scene-persistence
```

### Alternative Model: YOLOv8m (Maximum Accuracy)
- **Accuracy**: 88% relative accuracy  
- **Inference Time**: ~150ms
- **Benefits**: State-of-the-art performance for detailed scene analysis
- **Use Case**: When accuracy is paramount and resources permit

```bash
./object_detection --model-type yolov8m --enable-scene-persistence
```

### Fast Mode: YOLOv5s (Balanced)
- **Accuracy**: 75% relative accuracy
- **Inference Time**: ~65ms
- **Benefits**: Good balance for real-time scene monitoring
- **Use Case**: When continuous monitoring is more important than perfect accuracy

```bash
./object_detection --model-type yolov5s --enable-scene-persistence
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Scene Analysis Interval**: 60 seconds minimum between analyses
- **Database Growth**: ~1-2KB per scene (depends on object count)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (scenes loaded on-demand)
- **CPU Impact**: Analysis adds 5-15ms per scene (infrequent)
- **Storage**: SQLite database grows linearly with unique scenes

## Adjusting Scene Matching Sensitivity

The scene matching system uses a similarity threshold to determine when two scenes should be considered a match. This threshold controls how strict or lenient the matching algorithm is.

### Current Threshold

The default similarity threshold is **0.75 (75%)**, which means two scenes must be at least 75% similar across all comparison dimensions to be considered a match. This value is defined as a constant in `include/scene_manager.hpp`:

```cpp
static constexpr float MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.75f;  // Similarity threshold for matching
```

### How to Modify the Threshold

To adjust the matching sensitivity, modify the `MATCH_THRESHOLD` constant in `include/scene_manager.hpp` (line 93):

**More Strict Matching (Higher Threshold)**
```cpp
static constexpr float MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.85f;  // Requires 85% similarity
```
- **Effect**: Scenes must be more similar to match
- **Result**: More unique scenes will be created, fewer matches
- **Use Case**: When you need precise scene differentiation and want to catch subtle changes

**More Lenient Matching (Lower Threshold)**
```cpp
static constexpr float MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.65f;  // Requires 65% similarity
```
- **Effect**: Scenes can differ more and still match
- **Result**: Fewer unique scenes, more matches to existing scenes
- **Use Case**: When camera position varies frequently or you want to group similar scenes together

### Threshold Guidelines

| Threshold | Behavior | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 0.90-1.00 | Very strict - near-perfect match required | Detecting minute changes in scenes |
| 0.75-0.85 | **Default** - balanced matching | Most use cases with moderate camera stability |
| 0.60-0.70 | Lenient - tolerates significant differences | Unstable camera or highly variable scenes |
| <0.60 | Very lenient - may match dissimilar scenes | Not recommended (too many false matches) |

### Understanding Similarity Components

The similarity score combines three weighted components:
- **40%** - Object type counts (e.g., same number of cars, people)
- **40%** - Spatial distribution (objects in similar regions of frame)
- **20%** - Object relationships (similar distances/angles between objects)

A scene needs to score at least the threshold value across all these components combined.

### Example Scenarios

**Threshold = 0.75 (Default)**
- Scene A: 2 cars at positions (100, 100) and (300, 200)
- Scene B: 2 cars at positions (105, 105) and (305, 205)
- **Result**: MATCH (very similar, ~95% similarity)

**Threshold = 0.75 (Default)**
- Scene A: 2 cars, 1 person
- Scene B: 2 cars (missing person)
- **Result**: NO MATCH (~67% similarity - missing object reduces score)

**Threshold = 0.85 (Strict)**
- Scene A: 2 cars at (100, 100) and (300, 200)
- Scene B: 2 cars at (150, 120) and (350, 220)
- **Result**: NO MATCH (~78% similarity - positions differ too much for strict threshold)

### Rebuilding After Changes

After modifying the threshold, rebuild the application:

```bash
cd cpp-object-detection/build
make clean
make
```

The new threshold will take effect immediately upon restart.

### Testing Different Thresholds

To find the optimal threshold for your use case:

1. Start with the default (0.75)
2. Monitor the logs for "new scene" vs. "recognized return" messages
3. If too many new scenes are created (should be matches), lower the threshold
4. If scenes are matching when they shouldn't, raise the threshold
5. Adjust in increments of 0.05 and test

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Enhanced Object Analysis**
   - Detect sub-parts of objects (e.g., wheels on cars)
   - Extract shape features (contours, edges)
   - More sophisticated orientation detection

2. **Advanced Matching**
   - Machine learning-based scene embeddings
   - Temporal scene tracking (scene sequences)
   - Scene transition detection

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Configurable analysis interval
   - Adjustable similarity threshold
   - Per-object-type weighting

4. **Reporting Features**
   - Scene statistics and analytics
   - Most frequent scenes
   - Time spent in each scene
   - Export to CSV/JSON
