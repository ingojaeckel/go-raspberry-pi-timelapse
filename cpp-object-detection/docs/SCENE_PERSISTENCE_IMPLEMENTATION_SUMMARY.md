# Scene Persistence Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Scene Persistence feature for the C++ Object Detection Application, as requested in the issue "cpp-object-detection/: persist records of past 'scenes' in sqlite file".

## Requirements Met

✅ **Scene Analysis**: After 1-minute observation period, analyzes stationary objects including:
- Object types, positions, and orientations
- Dominant colors of objects
- Spatial relationships (distances and angles between objects)

✅ **Scene Definition**: Scenes are represented as tuples containing:
- List of stationary object types
- Positions relative to frame
- Object properties (orientation, color, bounding boxes)
- Spatial relationships between objects

✅ **SQLite Persistence**: Each scene is stored with:
- Unique ID (auto-incremented)
- Created timestamp
- Description (e.g., "2x person, 1x car arranged in frame")
- Object details in normalized tables
- Spatial relationships in separate table

✅ **Fuzzy Matching**: Scene recognition using:
- Object type similarity scoring
- Spatial relationship comparison
- Configurable position tolerance (default: 15% of frame)
- Configurable match threshold (default: 0.7)
- Works with slight camera angle variations

✅ **Feature Toggle**: CLI flag `--enable-scene-persistence` (disabled by default)

✅ **Model Recommendations**: Documentation includes recommendations for:
- YOLOv5s (default): Best balance for real-time analysis
- YOLOv5l: High accuracy for precise feature extraction
- YOLOv8n: Resource-efficient for embedded systems

✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide on tweaking match accuracy

    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    object_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
    object_types TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

CREATE TABLE scene_objects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    scene_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    object_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    position_x REAL NOT NULL,
    position_y REAL NOT NULL,

```

## Feature Extraction

### Color Analysis
- Extracts dominant color from object region using OpenCV's `mean()` function
- Stores RGB values in database
- Used as secondary feature for scene matching

### Orientation Analysis
- Uses image moments to calculate object orientation
- Computes angle from central moments
- Range: -90° to +90°
- Stored in database for future enhancements

### Spatial Relationships
- Calculates Euclidean distance between all object pairs
- Computes angle between object pairs using `atan2()`
- Used as primary feature for scene matching

## Fuzzy Matching Algorithm

The scene matching algorithm uses a weighted scoring system:

### Score Components

1. **Object Type Similarity (50% weight)**
   - Builds histogram of object types in each scene
   - Compares counts of each object type
   - Tolerates ±1 difference in object counts
   - Returns 0 if object count difference exceeds tolerance

2. **Spatial Relationship Similarity (50% weight)**
   - Compares distances between object pairs
   - Checks if distances are within tolerance (default: 20%)
   - Verifies angle similarity (default: ±15°)
   - Counts matching relationships

### Thresholds

- **min_match_score**: 0.7 (configurable)
- **position_tolerance**: 0.15 (15% of frame, configurable)
- **object_count_tolerance**: 0.2 (20%, configurable)
- **distance_tolerance**: 0.2 (20%, configurable)
- **angle_tolerance**: 15° (configurable)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
./object_detection --enable-scene-persistence
```

### Advanced Configuration
```bash
./object_detection \
  --enable-scene-persistence \
  --scene-db-path /data/scenes.db \
  --scene-observation-seconds 30 \
  --scene-match-threshold 0.8 \
  --scene-position-tolerance 0.2
```

### Output Examples

New scene identified:
```
[INFO] New scene was identified: id=1 - 2x person, 1x car arranged in frame
```

Recognized return to earlier scene:
```
[INFO] Recognised return to earlier scene: id=1 (match score: 0.85)
```

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

### Scene Manager Tests
```bash
cd build
./tests/object_detection_tests --gtest_filter="SceneManagerTest.*"
# [  PASSED  ] 6 tests
```

Test coverage:
- ✅ Database initialization
- ✅ Scene creation and persistence
- ✅ Scene recognition (fuzzy matching)
- ✅ Different scenes not matching
- ✅ Observation reset
- ✅ Configuration defaults

### Config Manager Tests
```bash
./tests/object_detection_tests --gtest_filter="ConfigManagerTest.*ScenePersistence*"
# [  PASSED  ] 2 tests
```

Test coverage:
- ✅ Default configuration (disabled)
- ✅ CLI argument parsing

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Minimal - scenes stored in database, not RAM
- **CPU**: Scene analysis happens once per observation period (default: 60s)
- **Disk**: ~1KB per scene (database grows linearly with unique scenes)
- **I/O**: Minimal - 1 write per new scene, reads for matching

## Integration with Existing Features

The scene persistence feature integrates cleanly with:
- ✅ Stationary object detection (uses existing tracking)
- ✅ Object tracking system (ObjectTracker)
- ✅ Logger (for scene identification logging)
- ✅ Configuration system (new CLI flags)
- ✅ SQLite (similar to Go configuration storage)

## Model Recommendations

### For Best Results

1. **YOLOv5l** (High Accuracy Mode)
   - Best for precise object identification
   - More accurate color and orientation analysis
   - ~120ms per frame
   - Command: `--model-type yolov5l`

2. **YOLOv5s** (Balanced Mode - Default)
   - Good balance of speed and accuracy
   - Suitable for most use cases
   - ~65ms per frame
   - Command: `--model-type yolov5s`

**Note**: YOLOv8 models (yolov8n, yolov8m) are listed in the help but are not yet implemented. They currently fall back to YOLOv5 models with a warning message. For now, use YOLOv5s or YOLOv5l for production deployments.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements identified but not implemented:

1. **Sub-part Detection**: Analyze object components (e.g., wheels on car, facial features)
2. **Semantic Scene Grouping**: Cluster similar scenes (e.g., "office scenes", "outdoor scenes")
3. **Time-based Analysis**: Track which scenes occur at what times
4. **Scene Transitions**: Detect and log transitions between scenes
5. **ML-based Matching**: Use machine learning to improve scene matching
6. **Advanced Color Histograms**: Better color-based matching

## Differences from Similar Features

Unlike the Google Sheets integration (PR #125, later merged):
- Uses local SQLite database (no cloud dependencies)
- Stores structured scene data (not just events)
- Implements complex matching algorithm
- Focuses on spatial relationships between objects
- Designed for long-term scene tracking

## Code Quality

- **Compilation**: No errors, minor warnings (pre-existing)
- **Tests**: 8/8 tests passing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guide
- **Code Style**: Consistent with existing codebase
- **Memory Safety**: Uses RAII, smart pointers, bounded structures
- **Error Handling**: Proper SQLite error checking
