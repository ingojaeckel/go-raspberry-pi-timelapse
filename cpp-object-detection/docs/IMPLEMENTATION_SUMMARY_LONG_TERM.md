# Implementation Summary: Long-Term Operation Optimizations

## Overview

This implementation comprehensively addresses all requirements for long-term operation of the cpp-object-detection application. The application is now designed to run continuously for days, weeks, or months without manual intervention.

## Issue Requirements & Solutions

### ✅ 1. Check for Potential Memory Leaks and Unbounded Data Structures

**Problem**: Data structures could grow unbounded during long-term operation, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **ObjectDetector Bounded Tracking**:
   - `MAX_TRACKED_OBJECTS = 100` - Limits concurrent tracked objects
   - `MAX_OBJECT_TYPE_ENTRIES = 50` - Limits different object types
   - `cleanupOldTrackedObjects()` - Removes oldest 20% when limit reached
   - `limitObjectTypeCounts()` - Keeps only top N frequent types

2. **PerformanceMonitor Overflow Protection**:
   - `MAX_FRAME_COUNT = 1,000,000` - Prevents integer overflow
   - `checkForCounterOverflow()` - Resets counters while preserving averages
   - At 1 fps: ~11.5 days before reset
   - At 5 fps: ~2.3 days before reset

3. **ParallelFrameProcessor Bounded Queue**:
   - `max_queue_size_` configurable limit (default 10)
   - Drops frames when queue full (logged as warning)
   - Proper cleanup on shutdown

**Files Modified**:
- `include/object_detector.hpp` - Added limits and cleanup methods
- `src/object_detector.cpp` - Implemented cleanup logic
- `include/performance_monitor.hpp` - Added overflow protection
- `src/performance_monitor.cpp` - Implemented counter reset

### ✅ 2. Ensure USB Camera Won't Go into Standby

**Problem**: USB cameras may enter power-saving mode after periods of inactivity, causing capture failures.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Keep-Alive Mechanism**:
   - Periodic lightweight operation every 30 seconds
   - Queries camera property (`CAP_PROP_FPS`) to prevent sleep
   - Minimal CPU overhead
   - Automatically called during frame capture

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - `KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 30`
   - Tracks `last_keepalive_time_` to avoid excessive calls
   - Debug logging when keep-alive performed

**Files Modified**:
- `include/webcam_interface.hpp` - Added keepAlive() method
- `src/webcam_interface.cpp` - Implemented keep-alive logic

### ✅ 3. Explore Resiliency to Cameras Disconnecting/Reconnecting

**Problem**: Camera disconnects (physical or driver issues) should not crash the application.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Health Check System**:
   - Monitors consecutive capture failures
   - `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES = 5` threshold
   - Health checks every 60 seconds in main loop
   - Automatic reconnection attempts on failure

2. **Reconnection Logic**:
   - `healthCheck()` - Detects failures and triggers recovery
   - `reconnect()` - Releases and reinitializes camera
   - 2-second delay between attempts
   - Comprehensive logging of reconnection attempts

3. **Failure Tracking**:
   - `consecutive_failures_` counter
   - Resets to 0 on successful capture
   - Increments on each failure
   - Triggers recovery when threshold exceeded

**Files Modified**:
- `include/webcam_interface.hpp` - Added health check methods
- `src/webcam_interface.cpp` - Implemented reconnection logic
- `src/application.cpp` - Integrated health checks in main loop

### ✅ 4. Explore Other Areas of Resiliency

**Problem**: Long-term operation requires monitoring CPU temperature, disk space, and other system resources.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **SystemMonitor Component** (NEW):
   - Monitors disk space every 5 minutes
   - Monitors CPU temperature every 5 minutes
   - Logs system statistics periodically
   - Automatic cleanup when resources critical

2. **Disk Space Management**:
   - Warning at 90% usage
   - Critical at 95% usage or < 100 MB free
   - Automatic cleanup of oldest 20% of photos
   - Cleanup runs hourly when critical
   - Prioritizes oldest files (by modification time)

3. **CPU Temperature Monitoring**:
   - Reads from Linux thermal zones
   - Warning at 75°C
   - Critical at 85°C
   - Gracefully handles systems without temperature sensors

4. **System Statistics Logging**:
   ```
   System statistics: Disk: 45.2% used, 5234.5 MB free | CPU temp: 62.3°C
   ```

**Files Created**:
- `include/system_monitor.hpp` - System monitoring interface
- `src/system_monitor.cpp` - Implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `include/application_context.hpp` - Added system monitor
- `src/application.cpp` - Integrated system monitoring
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added system_monitor.cpp
