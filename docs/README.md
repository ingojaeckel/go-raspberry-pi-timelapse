## For New Developers

If you're new to the project and want to understand the API architecture:

1. Read **OPENAPI_ARCHITECTURE.md** for the big picture
2. Review **OPENAPI_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** for practical usage
3. Check **ADR-001-openapi-migration.md** for design decisions
4. Run `./validate-openapi.sh` to verify your setup

## For API Changes

When modifying the API:

1. Update `../openapi.yaml`
2. Run `make generate` to regenerate code
3. Update handlers in `../rest/` if needed
4. Run tests with `make test`
5. Update documentation if needed

See [../OPENAPI.md](../OPENAPI.md) for detailed instructions.
